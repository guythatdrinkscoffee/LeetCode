# 589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal

# Problem Description

Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)

# Test Cases

- Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
- Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4]
